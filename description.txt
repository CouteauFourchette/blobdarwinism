What is this?

Blob Darwinism is a machine learning project that simulates an ecosystem of
small beings called blobs. Blobs seek to maximize their survival by moving
and eating food or other blobs.

The behavior of each blob is governed by a unique neural network which is
initially random. After a generation of blobs is simulated, a subsequent
generation is created by selectively inheriting genetics from the best
performers of the previous generation. In this way blobs naturally evolve
optimal behavior.

Users are encouraged to experiment with various simulation settings.
By changing rules of the simulation or features of the neural networks
many unique patterns can arise.
